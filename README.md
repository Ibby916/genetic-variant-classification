# Genetic Variant Classification with Machine Learning

This project uses the ClinVar dataset provided by [Kevin Arvai](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinarvai/clinvar-conflicting/) to predict whether a genetic variant will have conflicting classifications. The primary objective is to classify variants into one of two categories:
- **Consistent classifications (0)**
- **Conflicting classifications (1)**

By analyzing genetic attributes and applying machine learning algorithms, this project provides insights into the reliability of genetic variant classifications and supports researchers in their efforts to interpret genetic data.

## Dataset Description
The ClinVar dataset contains information about genetic variants and their clinical classifications. Key features include:

- **Genetic Attributes**: Descriptive information about the variant.
- **Classification Submissions**: Details about the variant's classifications from different laboratories.
- **Target Column (CLASS)**: A binary representation indicating whether the classifications are conflicting (1) or consistent (0).

The dataset helps identify patterns in genetic variant classifications, offering an opportunity to predict and better understand potential conflicts.
